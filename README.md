# CapstoneProject
WPI M.S. Applied Statistics Capstone Project

This capstone project was the culmination of my curriculum during my time in WPI's M.S. Applied Statistics program. It was a long and strenuous process, but I am very happy with how the final product turned out. Thank you to Professor Balgobin Nandram of the WPI Mathematical Sciences Department for the guidance during this undertaking. The project centers around using varying sampling/statistical methods to estimate household population parameters, with code snippets included in the PDF (R Language). Thank you for everyone else that helped and encouraged me along the way...next stop, back to industry.
